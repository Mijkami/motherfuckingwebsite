			<h1>This is a motherfucking website.</h1>
			<aside>And it's fucking perfect.</aside>

			<h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
			<p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:<</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>	
				<li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>	
				<li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
				<li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
				<li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Well guess what, mothafucka:</h3>
			<p>Nemo quaeso miretur, si post exsudatos labores itinerum longos congestosque adfatim commeatus fiducia vestri ductante barbaricos pagos adventans velut mutato repente consilio ad placidiora deverti. Postremo ad id indignitatis est ventum, ut cum peregrini ob formidatam haut ita dudum alimentorum inopiam pellerentur ab urbe praecipites.

			<p>You never knew it, but you just read some lorem ipsum non-sense, making this your perfect website. Here's why.</p>

			<h2>It's ubber-fucking lightweight</h2>
			<p>Et est admodum mirum videre plebem innumeram mentibus ardore quodam infuso cum dimicationum curulium eventu pendentem. haec similiaque memorabile nihil vel serium agi Romae permittunt. ergo redeundum ad textum. You noticed it ? I hope so.</p>

			<h2>It's responsive</h2>
			<p>Superatis Tauri montis verticibus qui ad solis ortum sublimius attolluntur, Cilicia spatiis porrigitur late distentis dives bonis omnibus terra, eiusque lateri dextro adnexa Isauria, pari sorte uberi palmite viget et frugibus minutis, quam mediam navigabile flumen Calycadnus interscindit. And they are not the only changes around there. Just similar s###t.</p>

			<h2>It friggin' works</h2>
			<p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>

			<p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>

			<p>Cross-loremipsum compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>

			<h2>This is a website. Is it ? Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>

			<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
			<p>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</p>

			<p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
